- `"E" collumn` is setted all decimal places of the calculate as defaul, but the "value" is a currency and not is interessing use more than two decimal places in your view. The `script` will to set your style with to fixed two decimal places.

---
- In this table you visualize `"E" collumn` with two decimal places, but the really value has more than two decimal cases.
- Example: In Naiara's row, the value is shown as `69.06`, but the really value is  `696.0587999999999`.
